# Mobile FlashCards

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React-Native App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app).

## About

A mobile flashcard game to help users answer study questions.  The default data is initialized with 2 decks: Javascript and React, each with 3 questions in the deck.  A user can choose to create a new deck, which they will then be directed to the deck view where they can choose to start the quiz or add a new question card to the deck.  If there are no cards in the deck they won't be able to start the quiz.  Upon completion of the quiz they will be shown their score and prompted to either go back to the deck view or restart the quiz.
